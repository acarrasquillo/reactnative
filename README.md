## React Native
In difference to other mobile development frameworks like ionic or framework7 where the application runs in a browser of the mobile device. This is because those frameworks produce html when you compile your application. React Native produces native code, this means that your compiled application is not running in a browser, **React Native does not** produce html. This means that your are using native views,buttons, text, etc.
